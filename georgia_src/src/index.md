# Tbilisi

Tbilisi feels like any other European city with lots of old and new architecture, visible Soviet influence, cool nature, and great food.

# Urban Exploration

One of the coolest parts of the trip was visiting [Tskaltubo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsqaltubo), an abandoned Soviet-era vacation town with tons of fancy sanatoriums (read: spa resorts for the elite).

There are tons of these buildings that have all remained unused since the Soviet Union fell and tourism to the city disappeared, though some have been squatted in over the years.

In total we visited at least 5 different complexes, paying a bribe (~$12) to a security guard to get into one and climbing over a fence to get to another.

The government is planning on selling or renovating some of the properties in the future, hence the fences and security.

# Svaneti

We spent two nights in Svaneti, a beautiful mountainous region in Georgia. We mainly came to see the towers in Ushguli but also ended up taking a 7 hour hike up to a glacier!

## Ushguli Towers

[Ushguli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ushguli) is a small remote village famous for its ancient stone towers. Other villages in Georgia have similar towers but Ushguli's are the oldest (at around a thousand years old) and most untouched due to the isolated location and current status as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Getting to Ushguli took many days on horse back in the day, but now can be done in a few hours on a very treacherous single road.

The towers were constructed as a defense mechanism against raids from other villages, so they were attached directly to houses and could hold families for long periods of time under siege.

The houses and towers have all been in continuous use since they were built, so there are families living in them today that have been there for >1000 years. One local showed us his house, which he currently doesn't live in and is renovating himself, and brought us up to the the top of his neighbor's tower.

## Shkhara Glacier

From Ushguli we hiked ~4 hours to Shkhara glacier and ~3 hours back. It was a pretty intense journey that involved fording rivers of freezing glacier melt, walking through knee-deep snow, jumping from rock to rock to avoid falling in water, and slipping on ice.

We also both got hella sunburnt :(

<div float="left">

# Martvili Canyon

We walked along the top of the canyon and then took a boat and paddled on the river.

The water was unbelievably blue and the foliage was crazy green. These photos are completely unedited and still don't compare to the real thing!

# Food

One of the main reasons we came to Georgia was to experience the food after we had both had Georgian food for the first time in NYC and loving it (Old Tbilisi Garden, Chama Mama, and CafeDelia).

Georgian food is *super* heavy on breads, cheeses, and meats, which means we often got full early and probably only averages one Georgian meal per day.

The main dish is Khachapuri, which is actually just a blanket term for any cheese bread and there are a dozen different ways to make it. The recognizable version for foreigners with the egg in the middle is Adjaruli Khachapuri which surprisingly comes from a [small corner of Georgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjara) and isn't actually the most common version eaten. You're meant to eat this version by stirring up the egg into the cheese then tearing off pieces of bread and dipping it in the molten cheese/egg mix.

We also managed to eat some veggies but they were few and far between.

Check out [all of Leo's restaurant reviews and photos taken](https://leo.adberg.com/food#georgia), but here's a small selection of pics:

IMG{tarragon, Leo's favorite drink was the [tarragon "lemonade"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarkhuna_(drink)) (no actual lemon), basically a soda with the flavor of absinthe. Tess was not a fan}
</div>

# Furry Friends

Georgia has **tons** of stray animals, and in some of the outdoor restaurants they are particularly bold about snagging food

IMG{kitten3, There was a family of cats living on the glass roof of the restaurant! The adult cats could climb up/down the brick wall but this kitten was unable to :(}
IMG{pig, }
</div>

# Rabies

It turns out there are some downsides to having stray animals everywhere...

Tess fed a hotdog to a scruffy dog on the street and it ended up biting her to get the food ðŸ˜±

Unlike the US, rabies is present in dogs in Georgia (and has a 100% fatality rate once symptoms show) so we had to go to a clinic and get her vaccinated.

In total there were four shots needed within the first day after the bite, with three more shots spaced out over the next few weeks. In the US this could cost [upwards of $10,000](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/2/7/16851134/rabies-treament-expensive-emergency-room) but in Georgia with no health insurance it ended up costing... $31.

IMG{rabies1, This went in the booty}
IMG{rabies2, }
IMG{rabies3, Continuing the bad luck, Tess also had an allergic reaction to the vaccine}
IMG{rabies4, More shots coming...}

# Country Roads

Georgia has some funky roads.

<div float="left">
IMG{bridge, Super sketchy bridge}
IMG{bridge2, }
IMG{bridge3, }
IMG{cows, During the entire trip we ran into more cow traffic than car traffic. When it's only a few cows on the road the drivers won't even slow down and will just swerve between them all at full speed, missing them by inches.}
IMG{horse, Ditto for horses}
IMG{road1, Sometimes the road falls off a cliff}
IMG{road2, And again (for the record: we did drive across this)}
IMG{road3, Georgian villages import a lot of used mini trucks from Japan and use them to get around, also horses}
IMG{road4, }
</div>

# Misc

<div float="left">
IMG{dadiani, Palace of the [House of Dadiani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Dadiani)}
IMG{oven, Allegedly an oven}
IMG{plums, The most popular item in the markets: sour plums. They're not meant to be eaten raw and were pretty nasty, but are a common ingredient in sauces.}
IMG{stalin, We stopped by Stalin's hometown, Gori, to see the Stalin museum and his old house. The tour was purely focused on how cool of a guy Stalin was and didn't mention anything bad about him ðŸ™ƒ. Thankfully, the average Georgian definitely does **not** have a good opinion of him.}

# Overall Thoughts / Recommendations

 - We both agreed that both the Tskaltubo abandoned buildings and Ushguli towers were the best part of the trip!
  - If we were to do it again we might try to fly from Tbilisi to Mestia to skip 7 hours of the drive to Ushguli, but then you'd miss out on Tskaltubo. So maybe drive one way and fly one way?
 - Georgian food is great but a bit too heavy and not diverse enough to solely sustain us.
 - Don't try to drive yourself! Drivers are cheap and easy
 - We went in May and would recommend it! The weather was perfect nearly the whole time except for a bit of rain. Apparently the summer is too hot and the winter is pretty snowy, making Ushguli completely inaccessible by car.
